What is?

This software was made to show how ECC can be implemented
with academical purposes, the target is to make a full
library, the status of this is just a demo showing en encryption
and decryption process using Elgamal over ECC with a finite group
of characteristic p with p elements using Sophie Germain prime.
of 192 bits.

What is in this distribution?

Light Elliptic Curve routines (LECC 0.2)
Elgamal routines 0.1 using LECC 0.2
LightMP library for computing big numbers 0.3 (bad performance for now) 


How to build?

use compile.sh to build

TODO

Implement LIGHTMP to work with 64 bit integers, clean de code 
and add more comments.

Who made it?
